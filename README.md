## Radical paradox

`Radical paradox` is:

* a blend of `pr-fluffy-cegont-paf-240626-007` and
  `pr-fluffy-cegont-paf-240709`, with some stuff taken out/history rewritten.

* a testbed for newer tools than raw git and Idea.

* going to be rewritten a couple of times before it's really beautiful.

* of the lineage of the above from GitHub.  I'll pull in the `kindof` stuff later.

* (idk) likely a merge point for the stuff from the other branches as well.
